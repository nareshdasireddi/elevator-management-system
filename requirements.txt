# Elevator Management System Requirements
# - Python program to determine the optimal number and capacity of elevators for a building
# - Prompts user for:
#     - Number of floors
#     - Total number of people during peak hours
#     - Maximum acceptable waiting time for an elevator
#     - Floor height (in meters)
#     - (Optional) Preferred elevator capacity
# - Validates all user inputs for correctness and positivity
# - Uses standard elevator planning logic and reasonable assumptions for calculations, including user-provided floor height
# - Outputs:
#     - Recommended number of elevators
#     - Recommended capacity per elevator
#     - Summary of calculation logic and assumptions
# - User-friendly command-line interface with clear instructions and error messages
# - Modular and extensible code structure for future enhancements
# - Compatible with Python 3.x and major operating systems
# - Intended for preliminary planning and estimation purposes only
